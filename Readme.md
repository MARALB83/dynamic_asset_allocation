October 7th, 2017

## **Summary**

The project was done for the MFE230T course "Building Machine Learning Systems: Tools, Platforms, and Financial Applications" of the UC Berkeley MFE Program.

Other contributors to the project were Pierre Monroy, and James Wang.

My contribution to the project was building the Python infrastructure that directed data cleaning, feature engineering, model training/assessment and strategy backtesting.

## **Python Files**

The implementation of the project was done through three Python files:

* **_MFE230T_project_solution.py_**: Main python file that reads the data, calls the backtester, and outputs results.

* **_data_module.py_**: data extraction, pre-processing, and cleaning module.

* **_Model Development.py_**: backtester module.
